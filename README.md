# 6-Cylinder-Radial-Engine
A CAD-based project focused on the design and working of a 6-cylinder radial engine, covering its mechanism, motion, and assembly
Overview
This project showcases the design and modeling of a 6-cylinder radial engine using SolidWorks. The model demonstrates the working mechanism, piston motion, and synchronization involved in radial engine operation. It is intended as a learning tool for understanding the principles of engine mechanics and motion.

Features
